    During my time at Uoft, I learnt two things. *First*, A.I. is really hard and impossible to implement. *Second*, coming to terms with the fact that I spent 5 years of my life learning the first thing. In all seriousness, the degree in Cog Sci and AI allowed me to dabble in computer science, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology and linguistics, providing both a balanced education with pragmatic skills.
